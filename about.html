        Looks like you wanted to know more about me. Well, you came to the right place :).
        So let me talk about myself from the very beginning of my existence. I was born in 
        a bustling city of Bundang, South Korea, where I spent most of my childhood in. 
        Shortly after I turned ten years old, my family and I relocated to the Irvine, California, 
        where I learned how to speak and write in English. After moving to Massachusetts for 
        highschool, I had a good four years to figure out where I wanted to start my career in.
