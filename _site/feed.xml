				<title>\[SideTrack 1]\ Polyglot</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I find myself in a pile of tasks I need to do, I always take some time 
to sidetrack myself. More often than not, taking a step back from all the busy work 
helps me, because it allows me to reorganize myself and do the tasks better when I come back to them. Perhaps this is just an excuse to justify myself procrasinating, but in my opinion, taking an hour or two everyday to take a real break rather helps than not. 
Seriously, I encourage you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I would like to share new things I find and learn during my sidetracks. I have been around this world about 20 years, but there are still a lot to learn and to be 
excited about. Welcome to Ryanâ€™s sidetracks.&lt;/p&gt;

or not, I hope you will find them amusing. Welcome to my sidetracks.&lt;/p&gt;
